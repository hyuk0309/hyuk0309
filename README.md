## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a Server Backend Developer with 3 years of experience, I specialize in Java and Spring, focusing on developing media services for a global fandom platform that serves 10 million MAU (Monthly Active Users). I have secured proven expertise in large-scale service operations by reliably handling peak traffic of up to 1 million concurrent users.

I am passionate about deeply exploring the fundamental principles of technology, and I systematically document and share my technical insights through a [personal technical blog](https://hyuk0309.tistory.com/), which has accumulated over 20,000 cumulative visitors.

My primary goal is to architect code with a highly testable structure. I currently manage and ensure service stability objectively by maintaining and applying over 1,000 test cases to the core operating service.
